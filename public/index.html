  <title>Free &amp; Open Source Postal Code to Electoral District Lookup</title>

  <p>Many websites designed to engage Canadians in the political process need a way to let people find out who their MP is. This is usually done with a postal code.<p>

  <p>Political parties do not need to pay to have this on their websites. Advocacy organizations however must pay <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?catno=92F0193X&lang=eng">$2,500</a> the first year, <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?catno=92F0193U&lang=eng">$500/yr</a> thereafter.</p>

  <p>This is a free alternative, based on data from Elections.ca.</p>

  <p>One legal opinion we received indicated this was legal so long as we did not make an unreasonable number of requests to their servers. For this reason, we only forward requests when they are made to us. We also make a copy of the result to avoid subsequent lookups for the same postal code.</p>

  <p>This service is powered by <a href="http://github.com/danielharan/postal_code_to_edid_webservice">open source software</a>. To use the API, refer to the <a href="http://github.com/danielharan/postal_code_to_edid_webservice/blob/master/README">README</a></p>

  <p>Others have tried to lobby for access to this data for years. Notably, Russell McOrmond wrote about has been documenting his efforts since 2005: <a href="http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/1607">Postal codes by federal ridings (2003 representation order) file (PCFRF) tools</a>.</p>

== Postal Code to Electoral District Web Service

Want to help users find out who their MP is based on postal code?

http://postal-code-to-edid-webservice.heroku.com/postal_codes/A1A1A1

returns: {"code":"A1A1A1","edid":"10007"}

For testing you can also try with:
  H0H0H0 (invalid. Shh, don't tell any kids)
  T5S2B9 (empty array)

In cases where an empty array is returned, it means it couldn't resolve, *but the code is valid*. In those cases you can redirect users to this URL:

http://www.elections.ca/scripts/pss/FindED.aspx?PC=#{POSTAL_CODE}&image.x=0&image.y=0

Let me know if you have any issues.

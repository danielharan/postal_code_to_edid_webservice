== Postal Code to Electoral District Web Service

Want to help users find out who their MP is based on postal code?

http://postal-code-to-edid-webservice.heroku.com/postal_codes/A1A1A1

returns JSON: ["10007"]

For testing you can also try with:
  H0H0H0 {"error" => "Postal code invalid"}
  T5S2B9 {"error" => "Postal code could not be resolved", 
          "link"  => "http://www.elections.ca/scripts/pss/FindED.aspx?PC=T5S2B9&image.x=0&image.y=0"}

In the last cases we couldn't resolve, *but the code is valid*. For now, the provided link can help users for that < 1% of postal codes find their MP.

Let me know if you have any issues.
